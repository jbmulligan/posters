Discovery of activities via statistical clustering of fixation patterns

Human behavior often consists of a series of distinct activities,
each characterized by a unique pattern of interaction with the
visual environment.  This is true even in a restricted domain,
such as a pilot flying an airliner; in this case, activities
with distinct visual signatures might be things like communicating,
navigating, monitoring, etc.  We propose a novel analysis
method for gaze-tracking data, to perform blind discovery of these
hypothetical activities.  The method is in some respects analogous
to recurrence analysis, which has previously been applied to eye movement data.
In the present case, however, we compare not individual fixations, but groups of
fixations aggregated over a fixed time interval, the duration of which is
a parameter of the analysis that we will refer to as delta.
We assume that the environment has been
divided into a set of N different areas-of-interest (AOIs).  For a given
interval of time of length delta, we compute the proportion of time
spent fixating each AOI, resulting in an N-dimensional vector.
These proportions can be converted to integer counts by multiplying by
delta divided by the average fixation duration, another parameter that
we fix at 280 milliseconds.  We compare different intervals by computing
the chi-square statistic.  The p-value associated with the statistic is the likelihood
of observing the data under the hypothesis that the data in the two intervals
were generated by a single process with a single set of probabilities
governing the fixation of each AOI.  The method has been applied to data
collected from pilots in a high-fidelity flight simulator.
